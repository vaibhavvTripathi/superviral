  script:
    "My sweet pup is 16 and is now struggling to get up and down our front steps to go outside.\n\nOur front steps measure 6 feet from the edge of the top step to the bottom step, so I'd probably need a ramp that's 8-10 feet long. I will also be working on a tight budget, about $50 all in. All the ramps I find on Facebook marketplace seem to max out around 6 feet.\n\nI searched through old posts and found some great stuff about building a ramp yourself, but can't find anything about how to attach/secure it when you have stone stairs!",
